                        <p>
                          An OpenStack setup usually consists of a very
                          large pool of compute, storage and network logs. 
                          One of the biggest challenges for OpenStack 
                          administrators is to <strong>monitor stacks and analyze 
                          logs for anomalies. There is a need for a tool 
                          to analyze the logs and provide a clean visualization.</strong> 
                          In this project, we propose to analyze various logs 
                          produced by different components of Openstack and 
                          also provide a visualization for an easier understanding.
                            </p>

                          The project is about the Analysis and Visualization of 
                          Openstack logs,<strong> with a view to aid Software developers 
                          in debugging of Systems </strong> that use Openstack infrastructure 
                          used in various applications of cloud computing such as 
                          email and SMAC.

                        <h3><strong>Future Scope</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                          The future scope of this project is to
                          analyze logs that are generated when 
                          Openstack is being used for application 
                          basis as well and not just to provide 
                          Infrastructure as a service. We can also 
                          do further research on ELK Stack and apply 
                          Machine learning Algorithms for analysis 
                          and try for a better accuracy.

                         The project also aims aid new users of the Openstack 
                         infrastructure in understanding the usage methods involved 
                         without having to delve deep into an understanding of the
